# Conformal-Prediction-for-Imbalanced-data
Thise repository is dedicated to experimental work with conformal prediction for imbalanced data. In particular, we do sort of experimental review of algorithms of the conformal prediction approach, where medical diagnosis data are employed for comparative analysis. This is a continuous work, started as part of a deep learning assignment.
