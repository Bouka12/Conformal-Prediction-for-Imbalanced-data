# Conformal-Prediction-for-Imbalanced-data
This repository is dedicated to experimental work with conformal prediction for imbalanced data. In particular, we perform an experimental review of algorithms of the conformal prediction approach, where medical diagnosis data are employed for comparative analysis. This is continuous work, started as part of a deep learning assignment.
